    "This analysis looks at school performance within the district based off a variety of factors including math scores, reading scores, percentage passing, budget per capita, and grade. A couple key insights I was able to find was that charter schools performed significantly better than district schools. Also, grade didn't necessarily factor in much... schools that had poor performing 9th graders also had poor performing 12th graders. Size of enrollment also contributed immensely with schools over 3500-4000 students having a much higher chance to perform poorly. "
